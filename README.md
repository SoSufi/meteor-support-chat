```

This package uses the following packages:
-"templating","underscore", "mongo", "session", "tracker"
- alanning:roles, momentjs:moment, mizzao:user-status

## Basic Usage

This package is pretty rough and ugly on the inside, but it seem to work reasonably fine. Eventually I might get around to do some refactoring.
